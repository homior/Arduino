Hello Dudes, 
first i have to say its my first time at Github and my english is not the best..^^

I want to build a LED Matrix with the ws281b LEDs. I already bought them and also started solvering, so please dont give me a answer like
"why u dont buy a complete matrix?", or "why do u use this kind of LED Strip?"... 
The matrix consists out of 14x15 LEDs and it is possible to controll each of them like leds[23]=CRG(255,0,0).
I use an Arduino Uno, to controll the LEDs. 

A part of my Code looks like that:

#include <FastLED.h>

// How many leds in your strip?
#define NUM_LEDS 29

// For led chips like Neopixels, which have a data line, ground, and power, you just
// need to define DATA_PIN.  For led chipsets that are SPI based (four wires - data, clock,
// ground, and power), like the LPD8806 define both DATA_PIN and CLOCK_PIN
#define DATA_PIN 6
// Define the array of leds
CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];



    
  void snake(int len,int pos){
    for (int t=0;t<len;t++){
      if(t+pos<NUM_LEDS){
          leds[pos+t]= CRGB(0,255,0);
        }
       else{
       leds[pos+t-NUM_LEDS]= CRGB(0,255,0); }
      }
        FastLED.show();
      for (int t=0;t<len;t++){
      if(t+pos<NUM_LEDS){
          leds[pos+t]= CRGB(0,0,0);}
       else{
       leds[pos+t-NUM_LEDS]= CRGB(0,0,0); }
      }
    }


  
void setup() {
  FastLED.addLeds<WS2812B, DATA_PIN, RGB>(leds, NUM_LEDS);
}

void loop() {
  for (int i=0;i<NUM_LEDS;i++){
  snake(5,i);
  delay(200);
  }
  }
  
  
  I would like to build a game like Snake or Tetris in the future.
  So i need to use my Keyboard to write a function like
  
  void move(int position){
  if(pressRight && (position+1)%14!=0){ //if the position is at the end of the map, he cannot move right
  leds[position+1];}}
  
  It is just an example how I would like to write the function. I know there is a possibility to create a twi dimensional array,
  so I dont have to do like (position+1)%14!=0), but thats a problem for the future ^^
  
  My problem i am asking for at the moment is how to use my keyboard to controll the LEDs in realtime and without using any other Pins
  at the Arduino instead of the Data-Pin 6, the Gnd Pin and the 5V pin.
  
  I just want to controll the code with an usb cable to the arduino. Maybe later i will add some buttons to the matrix and connect them
  to the Arduino, but at the moment I just want to upload the code to the Arduino and use "w","a","s","d" to move around the LED Matrix.
  
  Thank u for ur help!
